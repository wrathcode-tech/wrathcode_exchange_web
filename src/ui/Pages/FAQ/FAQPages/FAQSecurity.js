                  <p>Please follow the guidelines to secure your Wrathcodeaccount:</p>
                  <h6>1. Set up 2-Factor Authentication:</h6>
                  <p> Setting up Two-Factor Authentication will ensure that no-one can access your Wrathcodeaccount without obtaining both
                    your password and the second factor to your security - whether it’s your OTP or Google Authenticator.</p>
                  <h6>2. Always check your browser:</h6>
                  <p>Always make sure the browser you’re visiting is: https://coindcx.com/. If the website you’re on looks exactly like ours but
                    is even slightly different - you could be a victim of phishing and could lose control of your account. Remain vigilant!</p>
                  <h6>3. Do not share sensitive information:</h6>
                  <p>While our community managers on Telegram and our support teams regularly converse with users over chat or call, no
                    single Wrathcodeemployee will ask for sensitive information. The most any employee will ask is your email, phone number,
                    and Support Ticket ID.</p>
                  <h6>4. Use a strong password:</h6>
                  <p>We recommend that you use a strong password for your Wrathcodeaccount. While we have the highest levels of security for
                    our platform, using an easy-to-guess password leaves you liable to “guess-hackers”.</p>

                  <p>YProtecting Yourself from Phishing Scams: Stay Vigilant and Secure,
                    In a phishing scam, attackers attempt to deceive you by posing as trustworthy entities, aiming to obtain
                    sensitive information that can be exploited to access your devices and accounts, ultimately leading to
                    financial theft.
                    At our company, we prioritize your safety and security. It is essential for our clients to be cautious and
                    adopt good practices to avoid falling victim to these scams. Here are crucial tips to adhere to, helping
                    protect you from phishing scams:
                    We will:</p>
                  <p><strong>Never ask for your passwords: </strong>Under no circumstances should you share your passwords with anyone,
                    including us. Legitimate companies will never request this information from you.</p>
                  <p ><strong>Never request security settings changes: </strong>We will not ask you to alter or remove your security settings. Any
                    such request should be treated with suspicion..</p>
                  <p><strong> Never seek remote desktop access:</strong> We will never ask for access to your devices through remote desktop
                    access software. Refrain from granting such access unless you initiated it with trusted support personnel.
                    By being vigilant and adhering to these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to
                    phishing scams. Remember that your security is paramount, and we are committed to keeping your
                    information safe. If you ever encounter suspicious activity or have concerns, please contact our support
                    team immediately. Together, we can create a safer digital environment for everyone.</p>

                How can I add an address as a ‘Trusted Address’?

                <div className="faq_text" >
                  <p>Follow these steps to add new addresses to your Wrathcodeaccount securely:</p>
                  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong>Log in to your Wrathcodeaccount at <a href='https://Wrathcode.com/'>https://Wrathcode.com/</a> </p>
                  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on "Security" from the drop-down menu accessed through your Profile button. </p>
                  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong>The Security page will open, and you'll find the "Address Management" section. Click on the "Manage" button for
                    Address Management. On this screen, you'll see two essential elements:
                    <strong>Security Score:</strong>
                    <p>Your current security score will be displayed. Ensure it is up-to-date to maintain account security.</p>
                    <strong>Adding Addresses for Crypto: </strong>
                    <p>You can add addresses for different cryptocurrencies, which can later be whitelisted for
                      Trusted Withdrawals from your account.</p>
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click on the "Add Address" button, as indicated in the screenshot above. A pop-up will appear on your screen. Choose
                    the specific cryptocurrency for which you want to add the address since each coin has its unique blockchain address type and
                    specification.
                    Label the address: You can assign a label to the address for easy recognition. For example, "Abhishek" or any identifier that
                    helps you remember.
                    Paste the wallet address: Carefully enter the wallet address. If it belongs to a trusted person, like a friend or family member,
                    you can click on the checkbox to indicate it as trustworthy. Click on "Add Address" to proceed.
                    Please note that the address will only be added after entering your Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) code for added security.
                    You can then mark the address as a trusted one by selecting the checkbox under 'Actions.' However, the wallet will not be
                    confirmed as a Trusted Wallet until you verify it on your Wrathcoderegistered email address.</p>
                  <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> An email will be sent to your registered email address, asking you to confirm the addition of the new address as a
                    'Trusted Address.' Access your email and follow the confirmation instructions provided.</p>
                  <p><strong>Step 6: </strong>Once confirmed, your new address will be successfully added to your Wrathcodeaccount. Your account is now updated
                    with the additional address, enhancing the security and flexibility of your crypto transactions.</p>

                    For existing users of Wrathcodewho have already secured their accounts with a security rating of 4/4, their funds are fully
                    protected.
                    For existing users who haven't secured their Wrathcodeaccounts or new users joining Wrathcode , there are multiple ways to
                    enhance security for your Wrathcodeaccounts.
                  </p>
                  <strong>Strong Password: </strong>
                  <p>Ensure your account is secured with a strong and unique password. Avoid using easily guessable passwords
                    like "0123456789," birthdays, or school names. Keep your password confidential and change it immediately if you suspect
                    any unauthorized access.</p>

                  <strong>Enable 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication): </strong>
                  <p>Strengthen your account's security by enabling 2FA. Access "Account  Security  2
                    Step Verification" and follow the steps to complete the 2FA setup. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach
                    out to Customer Support via "Account Help & Support  Security."</p>

                  <strong>Use a Separate Withdrawal Password:</strong>
                  <p>For additional protection, set a strong withdrawal password different from your login
                    password. This precaution ensures that your funds remain secure even if unauthorized access is gained to your account. A
                    unique withdrawal password prevents unauthorized transfers to other addresses in the event of a hack.</p>

                  <strong>Manage Trusted Addresses:</strong>
                  <p>On Wrathcode , you have the option to manage a list of addresses that you trust for sending your
                    cryptocurrencies to have better control over your crypto transactions.</p>
                  <br />
                  <p>By implementing these security measures, you can significantly enhance the safety of your Wrathcodeaccounts, safeguarding
                    your funds and assets. Stay vigilant and proactive in protecting your digital assets from potential threats.</p>

                        Protecting Yourself from Phishing Scams: Stay Informed and Stay Safe
                        In a phishing scam, malicious attackers impersonate trustworthy entities to deceive you into revealing sensitive information,
                        aiming to gain access to your devices and accounts to steal your money. At our company, we prioritize your security, and it is
                        crucial for our clients to exercise caution and adopt best practices to avoid falling victim to these scams.
                        Here are important tips to follow for protection against phishing scams:
                      </p>
                      <strong>Never Share Passwords:</strong>
                      <p>We will never ask you for your passwords. Please refrain from sharing your passwords with anyone,
                        including us. Legitimate companies will never request your passwords.</p>

                      <strong>Security Settings:</strong>
                      <p>We will never ask you to remove or modify your security settings. If you receive any such requests, treat
                        them with suspicion and disregard them.</p>
                      <strong>Remote Desktop Access:</strong>
                      <p>We will never request access to your devices through remote desktop access software. Do not grant
                        access unless you initiated it with trusted support personnel.</p>
                      <br />
                      <p>By adhering to these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of falling prey to phishing scams. Your vigilance and
                        awareness play a vital role in ensuring the safety of your personal and financial information. If you ever encounter suspicious
                        activity or have concerns, please reach out to our customer support team for assistance. Together, we can create a secure
                        digital environment for all our clients.</p>
