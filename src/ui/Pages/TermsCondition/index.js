                    <h3>This Wrathcode Terms and Conditions Agreement ("Agreement")</h3>
                    <p>This Agreement is entered into between you (the "User" or "Customer") and C.V. TECH SERVICES CO., LTD. (the "Company"), a company established under the laws of Thailand. By agreeing that you have read, understood, and accepted all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you have effectively entered into this Agreement via the Company's service platform.</p>

                    <br />

                    <h3>Whereas:</h3>
                    <p>(1) The Company operates business as a digital asset trading center through the service platform. The Company’s services include the following:</p>
                    <p>Providing services for the purchase, sale, exchange, deposit, and withdrawal of supported digital assets, as well as other related and necessary services.</p>
                    <p>Providing USD wallets and supported digital asset wallets to facilitate the services mentioned in (1) above, as well as other related and necessary services.</p>
                    <p>Providing any other services related to the operation of digital asset businesses for which the Company is responsible and/or provides exclusively.</p>
                    <p>(collectively referred to as the "Company’s services")</p>
                    <p>(2) The User wishes to use the Company’s services through the service platform. The Company will provide these services, and the User will have rights and duties concerning the Company’s services according to the criteria and conditions set forth in this Agreement.</p>
                    <p>(3) The User acknowledges that:</p>
                    <p>Investment or transactions related to digital assets are highly risky, including risks related to value, volume, or transactions that may be impacted by various factors, both directly and indirectly, which can arise or change at any time. Such causes are beyond the Company’s control.</p>
                    <p>Businesses related to digital assets have unique features different from other businesses. A digital asset trading center is merely an intermediary for providing digital asset trading services. Its operating system and services depend on and connect with the blockchain network or the operating systems of digital asset developers. The Company may have to rely on parties related to digital assets, digital asset developers, digital token offering system providers, and/or other persons involved in the trading center’s services (“ecosystem-related parties”) to enable the trading center to provide services to users for each transaction. As the systems of these ecosystem-related parties are beyond the Company’s control, the Company’s services as a digital asset trading center are subject to the limitations, conditions, capabilities, and stability of the technology, blockchain network, or operating systems of the ecosystem-related parties involved in the Blockchain services.</p>
                    <p>(4) The User acknowledges the aforementioned risks and limitations of the Company’s services and wishes to use the Company’s services. The User has read, studied, and understood the terms and conditions of the Company’s services as specified in this Agreement thoroughly. Both parties agree to comply with the terms and conditions of the Company’s services as specified in this Agreement.</p>

                    <p>6.2 The User acknowledges that the Company&rsquo;s services are provided on the Company&rsquo;s service platform, as defined in this Agreement.</p>

                    <p>6.3 The User acknowledges and agrees that the Company&rsquo;s service platform may link to third-party services in various forms, such as websites, applications, software, or Public API (&ldquo;third-party services&rdquo;). These links are provided for the User&rsquo;s convenience. Allowing or permitting these links does not imply that the third-party services are endorsed, controlled, or the responsibility of the Company. Additionally, the Company is not an agent, representative, distributor, broker, client, partner, or authorized representative of these third parties. Therefore, the Company cannot guarantee the accuracy, reliability, or safety of third-party services and will not be liable for any loss or damage the User incurs from using or linking to third-party services. The User is responsible for thoroughly reviewing the terms and conditions of third-party services themselves.</p>

                    <p>The User also agrees that the Company has the sole and absolute right to decide whether to link or terminate the linking of third-party services, and the User will not dispute or claim against the Company for exercising this right.</p>

                    <p>The User must use their judgment carefully and cautiously when using information or content from third-party services for making decisions or using any services independently.</p>

                    <p>6.4 The User acknowledges that Public API is a method to connect the Company&rsquo;s service platform with third-party services. Such connections may experience issues, defects, delays, or incompleteness due to usage by the User and/or external parties involved in the Public API connection. Consequently, the Company cannot guarantee the completeness of the services or any services on the platform connected through Public API. The User agrees not to make any claims against the Company for damages, losses, or impacts arising from using the Company&rsquo;s services or accessing the Company&rsquo;s platform through Public API.</p>

                    <p>In addition, the User must not conduct any transactions through the Public API in a manner that could impact the service and/or the security of the Company&rsquo;s service platform. This includes but is not limited to behaviors such as sending commands or conducting transactions through the Public API multiple times within a short period, which could cause the Company&rsquo;s service platform to crash, slow down, delay the Company&rsquo;s services, or prevent other customers from accessing the Company&rsquo;s service platform as usual. The User acknowledges that the Company has the right to set conditions for the use of the Public API, including limiting rights and usage as appropriate. If the User uses the Public API in a manner that does not comply with the Company&rsquo;s terms and conditions, the User agrees to solely be responsible for, indemnify, and/or compensate for any damages, losses, and/or expenses incurred by the User, the Company, the company&rsquo;s directors, and/or third parties.</p>

                    <p>6.5 The User must ensure that their devices are not installed with any programs that might affect the service or the security of the Company&rsquo;s service platform, such as BOT programs or Remote Application. The User must not conduct transactions using such devices or programs multiple times within a short period, which could cause the Company&rsquo;s service platform to crash, slow down, delay the Company&rsquo;s services, or prevent other customers from accessing the service platform normally. The Company reserves the right to set conditions and limitations on the use of devices with such programs, including restricting rights and usage as appropriate. If the User uses any such programs in a manner that contradicts the Company&rsquo;s terms and conditions, the User agrees to solely be responsible for, indemnify, and/or compensate for any damages, losses, and/or expenses incurred by the User and/or the Company and/or the Company&rsquo;s directors and/or third parties.</p>

                    <p>6.6 The User acknowledges that the Company&rsquo;s service platform operates as a legal digital asset trading center, providing a central hub for buying, selling, or exchanging digital assets through order matching and facilitating users wishing to trade digital assets. The Company only provides services related to the Company&rsquo;s platform. Thus, the Company is not involved in being an authority, agency, advisory role, brokerage, representation, use, or support regarding any transactions or legal acts between the users on the platform and third parties outside of the Company&rsquo;s services and control.</p>

                    <p>The User agrees and acknowledges that the Company is not liable for any damages, losses, or impacts resulting from such transactions and legal acts. In addition, the User agrees to protect and hold the Company harmless from any liabilities, claims, lawsuits, or complaints arising from such transactions and legal acts.</p>

                    <p>6.7 The User acknowledges that the Company may allow the User to use services related to digital asset business operations as determined by the Company, for which the Company is solely responsible and/or operates exclusively (&ldquo;Other Company&rsquo;s services&rdquo;). The User agrees to grant the Company the right to set the terms and conditions for providing these additional services through the Company&rsquo;s service platform and/or other communication channels as determined by the Company. The User agrees to be bound by these terms and conditions.</p>

                    <p>6.8 The User acknowledges that the Company will send an annual report of the User&rsquo;s digital assets to the User. The delivery of such reports will be in accordance with the terms and conditions set by the company. However, the Company is not obligated to send the report if the User has no remaining digital assets in their user account and/or if their user account has been suspended. The User acknowledges that they can download the tax invoice for fees through the Company&rsquo;s service platform or through channels specified by the Company.</p>

                    <p>(3) The User uses any other services of the Company outside of (1) or (2) mentioned above, and such services have been successfully completed, but the User received money or digital assets or other benefits (as the case may be) exceeding the amount they should have received from using such services, or any actions related to the money or digital assets or other benefits from the User&rsquo;s use of the services (as the case may be) were not completed, resulting in the User&rsquo;s failure to pay the debt or pay it incompletely.</p>

                    <p>(4) Any other cases as may be determined by the Company.</p>

                    <p> (Hereinafter referred to in this Agreement as &ldquo;Excessive assets received by the User&rdquo;).</p>

                    <p>In cases where the Company is unable to reclaim the Excessive Assets due to the User having sold, transferred, or moved the Excessive Assets out of their USD or digital asset wallet, or any other reasons preventing the Company from reclaiming the Excessive Assets, the User acknowledges and agrees to comply with the Company&rsquo;s directives as follows:</p>

                    <p>Transfer or deliver digital assets in the same currency and amount as the Excessive Assets received by the User to the Company as specified. Compensate the Company with an amount equivalent to the value of the Excessive Assets received by the User as determined by the Company. Take any other actions deemed appropriate by the Company to compensate for the Excessive Assets received by the User. The User acknowledges and agrees that if they neglect, ignore, or fail to comply with the above agreement, they demonstrate an intent to defraud and violate the Company&rsquo;s rights. The Company has the sole right and discretion to terminate the service platform without prior notice and to take any actions deemed appropriate, including legal proceedings against the User.</p>

                    <p>10.3 The User acknowledges and accepts that investing and conducting transactions related to digital assets carries risks. These risks may stem from the high volatility of digital asset values, the success, failure, or various issues of projects related to digital assets, the stability and trust in blockchain technology of digital assets, the digital asset network, technology, blockchain network systems, or the Company&rsquo;s operating systems and services. These include related parties within the ecosystem who are involved in or participate in the Company&rsquo;s operations and/or services, or changes in circumstances resulting from information, communication, or publicity from any party that may affect the price, value, and transaction volume of digital assets, which can occur at any time.
